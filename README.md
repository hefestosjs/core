# Hefestos Core

Hefestos Core is the central module of the Hefestos Framework, providing essential components like the server, router, caching configuration, compression, logging, and more. Both Hefestos Core and the Hefestos Framework were built with the Bun runtime, which brings performance benefits and simplicity.

Use Hefestos Core to develop and run your project efficiently, taking advantage of Bunâ€™s seamless handling of JavaScript and TypeScript files. Bun automatically transpiles every .js and .ts file it runs, making any extra setup for TypeScript practically unnecessary.
